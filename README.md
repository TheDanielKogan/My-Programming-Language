# Information:
	This application is my own take of a programming language
	It's fairly simple to use and create mini 'programs'


# Installation:
	Go to releases tab of this github page
	Download 'My Programming Language.exe'
	Run the program


# Usage:
	The left box is the console in which you may type commands such as 'help' or 'run'
	The right box is the code of the programming language
	anything you write on the right box will get executed when 'run' is typed into the console
	
# Syntax / Coding:
	The way to code in this programming language is fairly simple
	You may print anything to the console just by using 'print(text)'
	You can create a variable by doing 'variablename = abc'
	Which will set the variable named 'variablename' to 'abc'
	You can then print out the variable by doing 'print(variablename)' which will print out 'abc' to the console
	You can also add on to the variable in the text by doing 'print(variablenamedef)' 
	which will print out 'abcdef' as it just checks for the variable name
	You may also get input from the console by simply writing 'getinput'
	When the parser comes to this line of code, it will wait for the console to give it some input before continuing
	You can then use this input by typing '{input}' wherever you want, for example 'print({input})' will print out whatever you typed
	Finally, there are if statements, you can check if something is equivalent or not equivalent to something using an if statement
	If you write 'if {input} is abc if not then 6' this will check if the input the console typed (if 'getinput' was used previously) 
	is equivalent to 'abc' if it is not equivalent to 'abc' it will then start parsing at line '6'
	You can do the same if statement but check if it isn't by simply doing 'if {input} isn't abc if not then 6' 
	which will just check if the input is not equivalent to abc and if it is abc it will go to line 6
